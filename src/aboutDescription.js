let aboutDescription = 
`Delaney Stewart is a 23-year-old interdisciplinary artist and printmaker based in Leucadia, California. Her practice is rooted in traditional and contemporary printmaking techniques that  highlight humanity's interconnectedness with nature but also shed light on the fragmentation between the two, inspiring ecological consciousness and kinship. Delaney’s work is crafted with a commitment to sustainability, influenced by close family ties to Japan, and guided by environmental reciprocity.

Delaney received her Bachelors of Arts in Fine Art + Language with Honors from the University of California Santa Cruz. Within her double majors, she had chosen Printmaking and Japanese Language Studies as her emphasis. After receiving her BFA, she studied traditional Japanese woodcut (mokuhanga) and papermaking at the Kyoto University of the Arts and Awagami Paper Factory respectively. She specializes in mokuhanga and relief work, while having experience in lithography, photo-intaglio, cyanotype, and screenprinting.

As an artist, Delaney seeks to collectively liberate and create harmony between nature, cultures, and communities to reimagine a more sustainable and reciprocal future.
