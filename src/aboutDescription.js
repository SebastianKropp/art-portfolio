let aboutDescription = 
`Delaney Stewart is an interdisciplinary artist and printmaker based in Leucadia, California. Through her artwork, she seeks to cultivate a deep connection between the viewer and the natural world by employing a variety of botanical and organic forms. Her pieces not only highlight humanity's interconnectedness with nature but also shed light on the fragmentation between the two, inspiring ecological consciousness and action. She sees climate justice as an intersectional movement, one that strives to be accessible and inclusive, and recognizes the importance of collective liberation.   

Delaney is a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree with dual majors in Fine Arts and Language, graduating with honors in both. Her academic journey was marked by a strong focus on Japanese Language Studies and Printmaking, drawing inspiration from both Photo-based and traditional print techniques. She has been awarded the Eduardo Carrillo Scholarship in pursuit of exploring printmaking, sustainability, and intercultural knowledge. As an artist, Delaney is deeply committed to using her platform to question our relationship with the natural world to create a more knowledgeable, sustainable, and reciprocal future.
